Stack ADT:
-ADT means abstract data type
-it refers to features and operations not implementation 
-Think of stacks as rings on a peg
-LastInFirstOut convention (LIFO)
-A stack is a list with the restriction that insertion and deletion
can only be performed from one end, called the top
-Operations: push(x), pop(), top(), isEmpty()
-these operations can be done at constant time O(1)
-applications: function calls/recursion, undo in text editor, balanced parentheses
