-Binary trees are not linear data structures
-Traversing a tree structure is not straight forward and requires its
own algorithms
-general techinques are breadth-first and depth-first
-traversal defined as selecting each node in the tree and reading the data contained
as efficiently as possible
-breadth-first is about starting at level 0 with the root node, then go to level 1,
then level 2, etc. getting each node per level before moving on to the next
-depth-first is about reaching all the grand children of a node before moving on 
to the other child. Imagine having the root, looking at the whole left subtree
and then looking at the whole right subtree
    -preeorder-<root><left><right>
    -ineorder-<left><root><right>
    -postorder-<left><right><root>
    -thing of root as "reading data" and left or right as "moving in a direction"
-this can be implemented using recursion
-Inorder is actually a binary search tree since the values are sorted from low to 
high
