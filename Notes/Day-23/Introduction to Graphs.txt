-Its a series of nodes/vertices connected by edges
-In the case of a tree, uf N nodes then N-1 edges, in other words one edge for each
parent-child relationship
-For a graph there are no rules for connections
-trees are graphs but graphs are not trees
-Graph:
    -A graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set V of vertices and 
    a set V of vertices and a set E of edges.
    - G=(V,E)
    -ordered pair:
        (a,b) != (b,a)
-Edges:
    -directed (one way) (u,v) (Digraph)
    -undirected (two way) {u,v} (undirected graph)
-Examples:
    -Social network like facebook: people are nodes, their friendships are 
    undirected edges between them
    -world wide web: links on a website go to another website but they only go
    in that direction, basically directed edges
-Web crawling is graph traversal
-weighted vs unweighted
-if you have a bunch of cities connected by roads, and you measure the roads by
distance, you have a weighted graph. Imagine choosing routs where the roads are 
shortest, you need the distances (weights)
-an unweighted graph is a weighted graph where all edges are 1 unit
-self-loop/edge:
    -why have an edge that goes to itself
    -an example would be a website that has links that point to the same page, serving
    as a refresh button
-Multiedge:
    -can be directed or undirected
    -imagine them as flights between cities, sometimes they only go in one direction,
    sometimes they go in both, and sometimes you have duplicates but they refer to 
    different things like flights (the flight would be the weight)
