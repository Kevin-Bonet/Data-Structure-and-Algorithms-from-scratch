-number of possible edges in:
    -a directed graph is 0<=E<=n(n-1)
    -an undirected graph  0<=E<=(n(n-1))/2
-dense:too many edges
-sparse:too few edges
-walk: a sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge
-path (simple): a walk in which no vertices (and thus no edges) are repeated
-Trail: a walk in which no edges are repeated
-closed walk: starts and ends at the same vertex and length of walk is greater than 0
-simple cycle: no repetition other than start and end
-acyclic graph: a graph with no cycle
-strongly connected graphs: if there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex
-if you have an undirected graph you call that connected
-if you have a directed graph that is not strongly connected meaning that there is 
not a path from any vertex to any other vertex, but if the edges were turned into
undirected then it would be a strongly connected graph, then that would be a weakly
connected graph
-if a graph is a disjoint connected components then it is not connected
-a binary tree is an undirected acyclic graph
-directed acyclic graph (DAG)
