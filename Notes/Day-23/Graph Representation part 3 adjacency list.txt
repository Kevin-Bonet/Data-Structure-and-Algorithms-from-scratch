- int *A[8];
-the basic idea is that each row can be a one dimensional array of 
different size
A[0]=new int[3];
A[1]=new int[2];
A[2]=new int[4];
-space = O(e) (e being exact number of edges)
-time = O(v) for linear search, O(logv) for binary search

struct Node{
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
}
struct Node *A[8]

-we basically use a linked list
-we use the array of pointers where each pointer points to the head of a linked 
list, in other words it points to a node

-that was all for an unweighted graph, for a weighted graph:

struct Node{
    int data;
    int weight;
    struct Node* next;
}
struct Node *A[8]

homework, see using a binary search tree to store these things, also look into 
adding and deleting nodes
