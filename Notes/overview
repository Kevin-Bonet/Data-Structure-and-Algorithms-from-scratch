What im looking to achieve is working knowledge on Data structures and algorithms. I figured the best way to do that was by looking up instrucitonal content on the subject and putting together working examples of each data structure and to put them on github. It would give me programming expereince and add to my "portfolio", so to speak. 

 

Currently looking to do these three videos: 

1) Data Structures - Full Course Using C and C++ 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31LgI4Y4DQ&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org 

 


 

2) Pointers in C / C++ [Full Course] 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

 


3)Data Structures and Algorithms in Python - Full Course for Beginners 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

 


 

I will watch the videos and make a github project where I write everything they write as well as develop some unit testing. I will also add some Text files that give explanations and comments about how it all works and my thoughts on it 

 

Im also interested in this OOP in python video:

Dynamic programming is a concept often used in interviews:
