what data structure will you use to store a modifiable collection?
we want to be able to perform the following operations:
    a) search(x)
    b) insert(x)
    c) remove(x)
good options are linked list or an array
both are unfortunately O(n) for search and remove, and O(1) for insert
binary search tree (balanced) is O(log(n)) which is an improvement

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which for each node, value of all 
the nodes in the left subtree is lesser or equal and value of all the nodes
in the right subtree is greater.

example, searching for 12:
                        15
                10              20
            8       12      17      25
root says 15, 12 is less than 15, so we go left
node says 10, so we go right
node says 12, we found it and can return it       
insertion follows the same rules
