What you do is change the head pointer to point at the tail node, making it the new head node 

Then you have every other pointer point in the opposite direction and you make the old head node point to null 

 

struct Node { 

int data; 

struct Node* next; 

}; 

struct Node* head; 

void Reverse() { 

struct Node *current, *prev, *next; 

current= head; 

prev = NULL; 

while(temp != NULL) { 

next = current->next; 

current->next = prev; 

prev = current; 

current = next; 

} 

head = prev; 

} 

 

unfinished, come back to this tomorrow, also take a look at previous lesson at the end, try to understand the business of the pointers and the flow of things, it's still confusing
