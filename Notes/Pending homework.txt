here are things to do that accumulate as I go through tutorials:
1) In day 8 (Print-linked-list), there is an example of how to implement fuctions 
without having global variables, use this example in work moving forward
2) day 11, implementing insert at tail
3) day 12, using stack to reverse: look into reversing linked lists
using stack
4) day 13, implement balanced parenthesis
5) day 14/15, implement evaluations of prefix and postfix problem statements
6) day 16, implement infix to postfix 
7) day-17, implement queues and circular arrays
8) day 18, implement a queue using linked lists
9) day 21, level order traversal not fully implemented
10) day 22, implement handling of duplicates and if you are getting results in 
sorted order
11) day 23, look up (make notes) and implement hashtables
12) day 23, implement a graph, an adjecency matrix, and an adjacency list
13) day 23, see using a binary search tree to store these things, also look into 
adding and deleting nodes
