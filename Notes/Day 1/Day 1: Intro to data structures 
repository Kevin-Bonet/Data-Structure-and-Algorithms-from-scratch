Looking to get 1hr of a video done, this may take much longer than 1hr 

Ill be taking notes in this page as well as coding on VSC and uploading to Github when im done 

 

 

Intro to data structures: (examples) 

-English dictionary is organized as a sorted list of words 

-City map 

-Cash book 

Formal definition: a DS is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it 

Can be used efficiently 

We talk about data structures as: 

Mathematical/logical models or abstract data types 

Consider how a tv can be abstractly viewed as a thing that plays audio and video  

A list is an abstract data type 

An array is a concrete implementation 

Implementation 

Abstract data type, define data and operations but no implementation 

 

We will see their logical view, operations, cost of operations and implementation 

 

I just realized that the video is broken down into lessons each very short (20min or less). It would be to my benefit to do at least one lesson per day. 

 

INTRODUCTION TO DATA STRUCTURES IS COMPLETE 

 

NOW ON TO: Data structures: List as abstract data types
