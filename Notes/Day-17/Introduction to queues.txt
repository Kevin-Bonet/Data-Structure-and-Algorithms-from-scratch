Queue AbstractDataType
Queues are FirstInFirstOut (FIFO)
A queue is a list or collection that insertion can only be performed
at one end (rear) and deletion can be performed at the other end (front)

operatrions:
1) Enqueue(x) or Push(x) | void Enqueue(int x);
2) Dequeue() or Pop() | int Dequeue();
3) front() or Peek()
4) IsEmpty()

Use cases for queues:
when only one request at a time can be processed
    1)    imagine a network printer, it can only print one job at a time, 
    so as it recieves requests it should queue them up
    2) process Scheduling
    3) simulating wait
